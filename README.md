# EcoSS

This repository contains code used to analyze the DALECev ecosystem model (Williams et al 2005) as a state space model.
Data is generated using initial conditions and driver data from the National Ecosystem Observatory Network's site at Talladega National Forest.
Relevant `C++` code is contained in the `src` folder, while `EcoSS` contains code for daily and monthly timestep models and different data cloning analyses

A compiled vignette, describing inputs that can be changed for the analysis code, can be found in `AEM_vignette.pdf`, while an uncompiled version can be found in `AEM_vignette.Rmd`
